                    Petra , originally known to its inhabitants in Nabataean Aramaic as Raqēmō, is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Petra lies around
                     Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin surrounded by mountains which form the eastern flank of the Arabah valley that runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.
                      The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the
                       capital city of their kingdom, as early as the 4th century BC.[7] However, archaeological work has only discovered evidence of 
                       Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC,[8] by which time Petra had become their capital.
                     The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity 
                    to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.

                        Access to the city is through a 1.2-kilometre-long (0.75 mi) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.
                         Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the 'Rose City' because of the colour
                          of the stone from which it is carved. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described Petra
                           as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage". In 2007, Al-Khazneh was voted one of 
                           the New7Wonders of the World. Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction.
                            Tourist numbers peaked at 918,000 in 2010, but there followed a temporary slump during the political instability 
                            generated by the Arab Spring, which affected countries surrounding Jordan. Visitor numbers subsequently increased and 
                            reached a record-breaking 1.1 million tourists in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above the 1 million mark.
                             Tourism in the city was crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic as visitor numbers plummeted to zero since March 2020. 
                             The Jordanian government has authorized excavations in front of the treasury to make use of the site's emptiness.</p>
