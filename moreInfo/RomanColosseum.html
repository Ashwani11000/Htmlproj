                    The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.
                    Built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete, it was the largest amphitheatre 
                    ever built at the time and held 50,000 to 80,000 spectators. The Colosseum is just east of the Roman Forum. 
                    Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir,
                     Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81â€“96). These three emperors are known
                      as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).

                        Although substantially ruined because of earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of
                         Imperial Rome and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist 
                         attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.
