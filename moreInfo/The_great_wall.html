                    The Great Wall of China is the collective name of a series of fortification systems
                       generally built across the historical northern borders of China to protect and consolidate territories
                        of Chinese states and empires against various nomadic groups of the steppe and their polities.

                        Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century BC by ancient Chinese states;
                         selective stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China.
                          Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. 
                        The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

                        Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls,
                         allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement 
                         of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers,
                          troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
